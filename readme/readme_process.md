# Scrum retrospective

## Scrum 1 retrospective 
[In this retrospective we did a custom variation of the scrum process, identified something we wanted to change, which encapsulates both start and stop]

Marta: 
* Continue: Meetings were very efficient/helpful
* Change: We do not have a story that links our pages

Jackson:
* Continue: Scrum process and artifacts
* Change: Use trello more

Michael:
* Continue: Meetings worked very well
* Change: Not having user stories

Dani: 
* Continue: Good pace, up to date with class requirements
* Change: Make better use of slack to have a continuous dialogue, switch to feature branches

## Scrum 2 retrospective 

Marta:
* Continue: Using slack, agile process, collaborating and help each other debugging.
* Start: Be more disciplined in estimating task duration and recording actual time spent, so that the burn chart is more useful.  
* Stop: Make sure we pull from master before we push new content, to avoid creating merge conflicts. Use more branches, avoid all being working in master at the same time. 

Dani:
* Continue: Agile and quick communication over slack, skype, and trello; proactive collaboration for group and individual tasks, for example, adding business style format to home page and narratives.
* Change: Meet more in person and prioritize conceptual understanding of tools over mechanical tasks.

Jackson: 
* Continue: Using slack, defining user stories
* Start: Sprint review
* Stop: Using trello for small small tasks, (if it’s a zero, track it yourself)

Michael:
* Continue: Group positions worked well; scrum master and product owner
* Start: Meeting more in person
* Stop: Using Trello for small tasks, more for strategy and general framework

# Teamwide:
